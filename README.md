# Structure-Finding-Submodularity

In this project we use the submodularity toolbox, written by Andreas Krause. We find structure in images
by transforming the image into a weighted graph and optimizing for a maximum weighted cut in the graph.
The maximum weighted cut of a graph is known to be submodular.

For more information about this project, consult the mini-paper included in the project.
